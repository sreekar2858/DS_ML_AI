## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/) or [conda](https://docs.conda.io/)
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) (recommended for fast, reliable installs)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/sreekar2858/DS_ML_AI.git
   cd DS_ML_AI
   ```
2. Install dependencies (recommended: [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)):
   - Using uv (recommended):
     ```sh
     uv pip install --upgrade --upgrade-strategy eager -r requirements.txt
     ```
   - Using pip:
     ```sh
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
   - Or using conda:
     ```sh
     conda env create -f environment.yml
     conda activate ds_ml_ai
     ```

## Usage

- Place your raw data in `data/raw/`.
- Use scripts in `src/data/` to preprocess data.
- Train models using scripts in `src/train/`.
- Evaluate results with scripts in `src/evaluate/`.
- Explore and visualize data in `notebooks/`.
